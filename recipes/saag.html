        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>North Indian vegetarian recipe. Using ghee (Indian butter made from cow's milk) is important, since ghee gives that special taste.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large dried red chile peppers (Optional)</li>
            <li>2 bunches fresh spinach, washed and chopped</li>
            <li>1 bunch mustard greens, washed and chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
            <li>¼ cup finely chopped onion</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ginger paste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic paste</li>
            <li>½ tomato, chopped</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon white sugar, or to taste</li>
            <li>¼ cup water (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the chiles into a dry skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir until the chiles turn dark red-brown in color and give off their fragrance, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat, allow to cool, and remove stems of chiles; shake out the seeds, and tear the flesh of the roasted chiles into pieces. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Place the spinach into a saucepan over medium heat; place mustard greens into a separate saucepan. If leaves are dry, mix in 1 or 2 of tablespoons of water. If leaves are still wet, just cover the pans and simmer the greens until tender, about 10 minutes. Allow to cool.</li>
            <li>Place greens together into the work bowl of a food processor, and pulse several times to break up the greens, then process to a paste, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Heat ghee in a large saucepan over medium heat, and stir in the cumin seeds, stirring for about 30 seconds or until the seeds sizzle and turn a darker brown color. Mix in the onion, cook and stir until lightly browned, about 3 minutes, and mix in the roasted peppers, ginger paste, garlic paste, and tomato. Mix in the pureed greens, bring to a simmer, and stir in salt and sugar to taste. If dish is too thick, mix in up to about 1/4 cup of water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the greens are the desired thickness.</li>
